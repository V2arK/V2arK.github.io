A personal website for Honglin Cao, @V2arK.

An undergrad of University of Waterloo, currently in term 2A, having a Co-op term.

This website is based on the template HTML5 UP, and some personal touch of adding masonry item support in Gallary.

Feel free to base your own website from this as well!

All contect info is inside the website!
